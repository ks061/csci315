1.1) All threads are taking turns using/releasing the chopsticks. After about a few minutes,
     the program runs into deadlock.

1.2) Deadlock has a possibility of occuring due to the following conditions:
     - Mutual Exclusion: One chopstick cannot be picked up by two philosophers
                         due to the atomic nature of locking/unlocking mutexes.
     - Hold and Wait: The philosopher can hold, for example, the chopstick to its
                      left while waiting for the chopstick to its right to be available.
     - No preemption: A philosopher cannot be forced to release their chopstick, such as
                      their left chopstick as mentioned in the hold and wait example above,
                      until they choose to (get access to the right chopstick, enter
                      their critical section, and then release both chopsticks).
     - Circular wait: This is possible if each philosopher in a circle waits on the
                      chopstick to their respective right.

2.1) Deadlock can happen if each of the philosophers picked up their left chopstick
     and wait on their right chopstick.

3.1) Since these solutions eliminate circular weight, deadlock is also eliminated.

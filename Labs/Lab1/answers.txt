(1.b) There are two instances of num: one in the memory space
      of the child and one in that of the parent. Upon testing by
      changing num in a pid==0 if block (child block) and later
      printing num outside the block, num is different for the child
      process and parent process. There are separate stacks for the
      child process and parent process.

(2.a) pid: stack segment (because it is a local variable in main)
      x: data segment (because it is a global/static variable)
      y: stack segment (because it is a local variable in main)
      i: data segment (because it is a global/static variable)
      j: stack segment (because it is a local/variable in main)

1. The dynamically-allocated data initialized by the parent process
   is inhereited by the child process.

2. The open files from the parent are also inherited from the child process.
   Essentially, pipes are a kind of file. It follows, then, that the
   pipe used by the parent can also be accessed by the child.

3. Both Linux files and pipes need to first be opened before they can be
   read to or written from. After being read to or written from, they should
   be closed. Using pipes is faster than using files because pipes use
   memory whereas files use on-disk storage.

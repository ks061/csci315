1. Instead of creating another process (a child process) with the execution
   of fork() while the parent process is running, we executed two programs
   (which are run by two separate processes) through two terminal windows
   and used TCP sockets to have them communicate with one another (interprocess
   communication).

2. Socket functionality is provided by the kernel; it is available on the system
   call level, as evident by socket's documentation in section 2 of the manual
   pages. It would be ill-advisable to communicate confidential data at the 
   user level, as users should not be able to tamper with the secure
   interprocess communication offered by sockets.

3. Pipes are easier to implement and, therefore, make more sense to use
   when required for communication between two processes on the same machine.
   TCP sockets, on the other hand, provide functionality for and will make
   sense to use for communication between two processes on different machines.

4. This function translates a user-inputted name of the host machine to 
   the IP address of the host machine.

5. getaddrinfo(3) might eventually replace gethostbyname(3).

   getaddrinfo(3) have supports IPv6 and DNS lookups.

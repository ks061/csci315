3. 

rand(3) is not thread-safe because the seed is stored in one memory location
that is referred to by all calls (made by different threads) to rand(3). On the
other hand, rand_r(3) is thread-safe because one passes in a pointer to
a seed that specifies a particular spot to store the seed for each call
(made by different threads).
